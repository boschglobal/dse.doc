# Run a simulation. $ simer path/to/simulation -stepsize 0.0005 -endtime 0.04 Simulation Setup Structure The structure of a simulation is flexible and can be arranged based on individual project needs. All paths used within a simulation configuration should be relative to the root of the simulation folder (i.e. the simulation path). The simer tool will search for YAML files contained within the simulation path and automatically configure, and then run, the contained simulation.</description></item><item><title>Simulation Framework Benchmark</title><link>https://boschglobal.github.io/dse.doc/docs/arch/benchmark/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://boschglobal.github.io/dse.doc/docs/arch/benchmark/</guid><description>Overview The following Simulation Framework Benchmarks give an understanding of how the Dynamic Simulation Environment performs for a variety of simulation topologies. This information can be used to decide on a deployment strategy for a simulation that takes into account:
The total number of signals in a simulation. How many models are configured in a simulation. The expected amount of signal exchange per simulation step (throughput). Each of these benchmarks are evaluated across a subset of recommended simulation topologies.</description></item><item><title>Simulation Topology</title><link>https://boschglobal.github.io/dse.doc/docs/arch/topology/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://boschglobal.github.io/dse.doc/docs/arch/topology/</guid><description>Overview The Dynamic Simulation Environment provides several simulation topologies, all of which support distributed simulations, that may incorporate models running on multiple OS/Arch combinations or running in multiple simulation environments.
These topologies include:
Standalone - Stacked model instances running in a single process. Uses a Loopback SimBus. Distributed - Distributed model instances, multi process, multi OS, optionally stacked. Uses a Redis SimBus. Gateway - Remote simulation systems are connected with a gateway model.</description></item><item><title>Simulation Transports</title><link>https://boschglobal.github.io/dse.doc/docs/arch/transport/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://boschglobal.github.io/dse.doc/docs/arch/transport/</guid><description>Overview A Simulation Transport specifies how data-exchange between Models is facilitated by a simulation environment. Each transport has its own specific properties and the selection of a transport will be determined by the planned operational deployment of a simulation.
Transport Latency Status Loopback Fastest Available, stacked simulations (single process). TCP Fastest Planned. Redis Faster Recommended. Redis PubSub Fast Available, stable. RESP Fast Under consideration, for cloud connectivity (tunnelling). gPPC Fast Under consideration, for cloud connectivity (HTTP).</description></item><item><title>Testing with Testscript</title><link>https://boschglobal.github.io/dse.doc/docs/devel/testing/testscript/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://boschglobal.github.io/dse.doc/docs/devel/testing/testscript/</guid><description>Testscript for E2E Testing DSE Projects can use Testscript to run End-to-end tests (E2E) which are written in the (simple) txtar format. The containerised runtime supports both the Simer simulation runner as well as Taskfile based workflows.
