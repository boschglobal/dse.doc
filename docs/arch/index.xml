Those signals can be either:
scalar : Internally represented as a 64bit storage container (double). These values are transparently exchanged between models, and those models may cast the values to other types (as required by the simulation designer). binary : Binary strings (i.e. including embedded NULL characters) can be exchanged between models, and with an associated MIME type, complex bus simulations can be realised.</description></item><item><title>Gateway Models</title><link>https://boschglobal.github.io/dse.doc/docs/arch/gateway/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://boschglobal.github.io/dse.doc/docs/arch/gateway/</guid><description>Synopsis The Dynamic Simulation Environment (DSE) provides a Gateway API which can be used to connect remote simulations, via a gateway model, to a running DSE simulation. A gateway model takes care of signal exchange and time synchronisation between the remote simulation and the DSE simulation. Signals can be either scalar values or binary strings, the latter enabling virtual bus connections between simulation environments.
The gateway model runs in the remote simulation, and is written in that systems native language (or modelling construct).</description></item></channel></rss>
