This information can be used to decide on a deployment strategy for a simulation that takes into account:
The total number of signals in a simulation. How many models are configured in a simulation. The expected amount of signal exchange per simulation step (throughput). Each of these benchmarks are evaluated across a subset of recommended simulation topologies.</description></item><item><title>Simulation Topology</title><link>https://boschglobal.github.io/dse.doc/docs/arch/topology/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://boschglobal.github.io/dse.doc/docs/arch/topology/</guid><description>Overview The Dynamic Simulation Environment provides several simulation topologies, all of which support distributed simulations, that may incorporate models running on multiple OS/Arch combinations or running in multiple simulation environments.
These topologies include:
Model Runtime - Stacked model instance (single process) / Loopback SimBus Stacked w. Redis - Stacked model instance (single process) / Redis SimBus Distributed w. Redis - Distributed model instances (process per model) / Redis SimBus Gateway - Remote simulation systems are connected with a gateway model / Redis SimBus MCL - Foreign models are imported via a Model Compatibility Library / Loopback SimBus Realtime - Distributed and Stacked model instances / Loopback &amp;amp; Redis SimBus Embedded - External models and sensors and connected with a POP model / TCP These topologies are supported by the Simer docker appliance (Linux) and ModelC runtime (Linux/Windows).</description></item><item><title>Simulation Transports</title><link>https://boschglobal.github.io/dse.doc/docs/arch/transport/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://boschglobal.github.io/dse.doc/docs/arch/transport/</guid><description>Overview A Simulation Transport specifies how data-exchange between Models is facilitated by a simulation environment. Each transport has its own specific properties and the selection of a transport will be determined by the planned operational deployment of a simulation.
Transport Latency Status Loopback Fastest Available, stacked simulations (single process). TCP Fastest Planned. Redis Faster Recommended. Redis PubSub Fast Available, stable. RESP Fast Under consideration, for cloud connectivity (tunnelling). gPPC Fast Under consideration, for cloud connectivity (HTTP).</description></item><item><title>Model Compatibility Library</title><link>https://boschglobal.github.io/dse.doc/docs/arch/mcl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://boschglobal.github.io/dse.doc/docs/arch/mcl/</guid><description>Synopsis The Model Compatibility Library (MCL) of the Dynamic Simulation Environment (DSE) is a representation of an Architectural Pattern for supporting 3rd-party model interfaces in a DSE Simulation. To support a model interface an implementation will need to implement the MCL API (i.e. MclVTable) and may also optionally use the Marshal API to manage signal/variable exchange with the model being interfaced.

Those signals can be either:
scalar : Internally represented as a 64bit storage container (double). These values are transparently exchanged between models. Models may cast/convert these scalar values to other types as required. binary : Binary strings, which may container embedded NULL values, can be exchanged between models. Additionally a binary signal may be annotated with a MIME type which describes the content of a binary signal.</description></item><item><title>Gateway Models</title><link>https://boschglobal.github.io/dse.doc/docs/arch/gateway/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://boschglobal.github.io/dse.doc/docs/arch/gateway/</guid><description>Synopsis The Dynamic Simulation Environment (DSE) provides a Gateway API which can be used to connect remote simulations, via a gateway model, to a running DSE simulation. A gateway model takes care of signal exchange and time synchronisation between the remote simulation and the DSE simulation. Signals can be either scalar values or binary strings, the latter enabling virtual bus connections between simulation environments.
The gateway model runs in the remote simulation, and is written in that systems native language (or modelling construct).</description></item></channel></rss>
